In order to exit the game you have to alt + f4 (or if you have a device, such as, a macc, chromebook, or other laptop, 
you can aslo just hit the windows key, then right click the executable window to then close it there

the brown power-ups are the ones that refill your ammo

the yellow power-ups are the ones that increase your movement meter

the red power-ups increase your damage 

*note* if there is some bug hit M2 to reset the game, if there is still some bug (which there shouldn't be, then just
 exit and reenter)
